Provisions: Article 386 of the Penal Code  
Time of commission of the act:  
Result (innocent, guilty):  
Reasoning: Conviction for computer fraud committed repeatedly and professionally with a total benefit and damage exceeding €30,000. According to the majority opinion, the charge is substantiated in both its objective and subjective aspects, and the defendant must be declared guilty of the aforementioned criminal acts of fraud by means of a computer, committed repeatedly by a perpetrator acting professionally, where the total financial benefit and corresponding damage exceed the amount of €30,000, as well as for repeated embezzlement.

Facts: The defendant accessed a website using a computer, employing, without the knowledge and consent of the complainants, the access codes for the electronic management system of the bank accounts held by the complainants at a Bank, and transferred money through electronically transmitted orders from the complainants' accounts to her own account. Specifically, during the period from June 2007 to June 2008, after unlawfully acquiring the aforementioned STICK containing the access codes, she accessed a website maintained by ..., using, without the complainants' knowledge (without their consent or approval), the access codes for the electronic management system of the bank accounts held at the aforementioned Bank, transferring through electronically transmitted orders to the joint account number ... of the complainants from bank accounts numbered ..., ..., and ..., the total amount of €55,710, as detailed in the orders, and subsequently, using an ATM card, she gradually withdrew from the aforementioned account number ..., the total amount of €55,710, making 84 individual withdrawals from automatic teller machines. In addition, the defendant, during the period from June 2008 to November 2008, in the same exact manner (through the electronic management system of the bank accounts), transferred through electronically transmitted orders to account number ..., which she had opened at ..., from the complainants' bank accounts numbered ..., ..., ..., ..., and ..., the total amount of €73,942, as detailed in the orders regarding the transfers of these amounts. Furthermore, during the period from February 2008 to November 2008, through multiple acts constituting a continuation of the crime, although she had received from the first complainant ... the amounts of €695.04, €695.04, and €845.04, in order to pay his insurance contributions to O.A.E.E. for the periods of January-February 2008, May-June 2008, and September-October 2008, as well as the amounts of €250 and €280, in order to settle credit card bills for "...", respectively, and from the second complainant ... she received the amounts of €283.64, €419.26, and €385.38, to pay the latter's insurance contributions to O.A.E.E. for the periods of July-August 2007, May-June 2008, September-October 2008, and November-December 2008, as well as the amount of €1,888.03 for the settlement of VAT, she never paid the above amounts to settle the aforementioned obligations, nor did she return them to the complainants, despite being urged to do so, but incorporated them into her assets and wrongfully appropriated them. The defendant denies the charges against her and claims that the withdrawals were made by the second complainant and that all the amounts transferred to her account were transferred to cover the company's expenses and their personal expenses, due to her cohabitation with the second complainant and with his knowledge, with whom she intended to marry. However, this claim is not supported by any evidence; on the contrary, it emerged that she conducted the transfers of the money and withdrawals without the complainants' knowledge, and when she learned that they had been informed about the account movements and met at the Bank, her behavior and demeanor indicated guilt, according to the testimony of the prosecution witness ..., an employee of the Pangrati branch of ..., who saw her on the same day at the aforementioned Bank when she met with the complainants. The ongoing act of fraud using a computer was committed by the defendant professionally, as evidenced by her repeated commission of the act, as well as the infrastructure she had established with the intent of repeated commission, based on a specific plan and methodology (transferring smaller amounts to a joint account of the complainants from the remaining accounts of the latter, and then withdrawing the transferred amounts with an ATM card, as well as directly transferring smaller amounts from the complainants' accounts to her personal account she had opened at the same bank), indicating her purpose to generate income, with the financial benefit she gained, corresponding to the complainants' damage, exceeding a total of €30,000.
