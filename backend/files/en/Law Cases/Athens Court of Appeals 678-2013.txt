Factual circumstances: An unknown individual, using social engineering techniques and information that had been intercepted (password, passport details, etc.), pretended over the phone to be the legitimate beneficiary of a bank account and managed to change the registered phone number, gain access to the account, and illegally transfer the amount of $427,620 to an account in Greece. The transfer was carried out via email, using the online banking system. The actual pair of beneficiaries of the account never requested a money transfer, a change of phone number, or a change of access codes. The person who received the money and his company, while being aware of the criminal origin of the funds, proceeded to conceal them by hiding them in the corporate account. Furthermore, the unknown individual attempted other similar money transfers (e.g., $125,000 to Texas, $321,650 to Japan), demonstrating repeated, organized, and professional activity. The court considered his actions to be particularly dangerous and antisocial, with evidence indicating a consistent tendency towards committing similar crimes. There was also previous infrastructure for committing the fraud, such as an account in a company in the Seychelles, the use of a false address, orders via fax, and correspondence with fictitious details.
