Claim regarding the lifting of the criminal liability, due to the absence of criminal prosecution in America within the legal period of 3 years. The independent claim is rejected, as the provisions regarding the deadline for the initiation of criminal proceedings, according to the Greek Institute of International and Foreign Law, do not apply while the perpetrator is evading arrest. Imposition of a 10-year prison sentence and deprivation of civil rights for 3 years. Orders lifelong expulsion from the country after the complete serving of the sentence.
