**Court (Civil/Criminal): Civil  
Provisions:  
Time of commission of the act:  
Outcome (not guilty, guilty): Rejects the lawsuit.  
Reasoning:  
Facts: The plaintiff holds account number ....................... at the defendant bank. Following the application/contract dated January 9, 2019, the plaintiff became a subscriber to the alternative service networks provided by the defendant bank through online banking (.........................). In the aforementioned application, the plaintiff stated that her mobile phone (number .................) would be used by the defendant to send additional security codes for the approval of her transactions via .......................... It is noted that the plaintiff received subscriber code .................., thus enabling her to conduct transactions without her physical presence at the branches of the defendant bank, from fixed or mobile devices (computers, smartphones, tablets), by entering her username and password to access her personal account. Regarding the identification methods, these were agreed upon between the parties and are specified depending on the payment method used. More specifically, the plaintiff had installed the application ...................................... on her mobile phone. According to the terms of the above contract between the parties, the defendant bank (to ensure the protection of its customers in using this application) requires three stages of identification: 1) the input of the customer's personal codes (username and password) in the application .........................., 2) the input of a six-digit code (...................) sent via SMS to the mobile number provided by the customer, to complete the login to ............................. and 3) the input of a new six-digit code (.................) sent in a new SMS to the mobile number provided by the customer, to authenticate the device on which the aforementioned application is installed (usually a mobile phone). 

Furthermore, it was established that on October 4, 2021, at 00:07, the plaintiff received a text message (SMS) on her mobile phone (number ...................) with the following content: ".................................", i.e., "..........: a payment was attempted from a new device. If this was not you, please visit...", providing the above link. As she acknowledges in her lawsuit, she followed the link that was sent to her via SMS and entered her login credentials (i.e., username and password) on the (fake) page she was redirected to. Thus, the perpetrators acquired the plaintiff's personal information and subsequently entered it into the application ........................... that they had installed on their own mobile phone. Following this, to complete the second stage of the process, as described above, the defendant bank sent the aforementioned date and time of 00:14, a security code to the plaintiff's mobile phone via SMS, with the content ".................................`." Subsequently, the defendant sent, at 00:17, another SMS to the plaintiff's mobile phone with the security code .................., containing the message ".........................................", to complete the third stage of identification. It is noted that the defendant sent another message to the plaintiff's mobile phone at 00:15, specifically "..........................", which was not used (perhaps because it was entered incorrectly by the plaintiff). It was later proven that the unknown perpetrators charged the plaintiff's account with a total amount of €2,800.00 and an equivalent credit to a bank account held similarly at the defendant bank, with the beneficiary being ............. The plaintiff contacted the defendant, submitting a dispute over the above transactions and simultaneously filed a complaint against any responsible party for the crimes of fraud and embezzlement. The defendant locked the plaintiff's subscription and provided her with new codes, warning her not to use the aforementioned application via her mobile phone unless she scanned it with updated antivirus/antispyware/malware software. Additionally, the defendant froze the account to which her money was transferred, which, as mentioned earlier, belongs to ................., who also stated that she fell victim to electronic fraud, being used by the aforementioned perpetrators as a front person. It was further established that the above-mentioned ......................... consented to the return to the plaintiff of the amount of €239.54, which remained in her account (as part of the aforementioned €2,800.00), while the plaintiff stated in a declaration that after the crediting of her account with the amount of €239.54, she has no further claims against the defendant regarding the above history. From the above proven facts, it was established that the plaintiff accessed the fraudulent page, entering her username and password and subsequently the codes ....., which were sent to her mobile phone by the defendant bank. Regarding the defendant, it was established that through its website ......................, through the login page to ................ and via messages to its subscribers, it informs them in detail about the risks of code interception and the protective measures they should take, while it also informs them with a special announcement about phishing. For this reason, the plaintiff's assertion that the perpetrators used one-time codes ......, violating the defendant's security systems, must be dismissed as unfounded. Therefore, since the defendant successfully identified the plaintiff's identity as well as her mobile phone without any indication of a breach of its electronic systems, the defendant is not liable for the plaintiff's loss from the transfer of funds to an unknown person's account, nor is it responsible for compensating that loss. Given these circumstances, the lawsuit must be dismissed as fundamentally unfounded.**
