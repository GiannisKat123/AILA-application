**Court (Civil/Criminal):**
Provisions: Articles 8 of Law 2251/1994, Articles 2, 4, 48 et seq. of Law 4537/2018, Article 11 paragraph 1 of Law 4261/2014, Articles 830, 806, 827, 914, 932 of the Civil Code and 176 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Time of commission of the act:
Outcome (not guilty, guilty):
Rationale: Electronic fraud through the method of phishing. A third party fraudulently obtained money from the plaintiff's bank account and transferred it to another bank account. Both the defendant is liable for the inadequate protection of its systems, which should have been excellent, and the plaintiff who failed to fulfill his obligation to protect his information and disregarded the defendant's security instructions. Law 4537/2018 introduces mandatory law in favor of users, as according to Article 103, payment service providers are prohibited from deviating from the provisions to the detriment of payment service users. It is determined that a resumption of the discussion should be ordered in order to provide all possible evidence, with diligence from both parties, especially from the defendant, who has access to the transaction data through its systems, but also bears the relevant burden of proof concerning the exact timing of the execution of the money transfer order at each stage (withdrawal from the plaintiff's account, transfer to another bank, transfer to the third party's account).
Facts: The plaintiff maintains a joint bank account with his wife at the defendant bank and has also agreed to online banking transactions (e-banking). On July 31, 2020, at 13:45, the plaintiff was informed of a transfer of €3,000 from his account, which he had not initiated, nor had his wife. At 14:05, he immediately contacted the bank’s customer service line and reported the incident, stating that it was not his action and requesting its cancellation. The bank employee found that the plaintiff had provided his details to a fake website 10 days earlier, and subsequently, the mobile number used for transaction confirmations had been changed. The employee informed him that the money was at the other bank and that they would logically be able to retrieve it, provided it had not already been transferred to a third party's account. Since then, the plaintiff has not seen any return of the amount to his account, and he has made numerous attempts to resolve the issue with the bank, with effort, costs, and distress; however, nothing was achieved, as the money had already entered a third party's account and the defendant denied responsibility for the transfer of the funds.
Facts: The plaintiff maintained a joint account with his wife at a bank and used internet banking services. On July 21, 2020, a third party deceived the plaintiff through phishing (a misleading SMS with a link), obtaining his banking credentials. The third party, using the stolen information, requested a phone number change for receiving OTP (one-time password) and completing electronic transactions. The bank completed the change process based on the correct credentials. On July 31, 2020, a transfer of €3,000 was made from the plaintiff's account to a third party. The plaintiff was immediately informed, called the bank, and reported the fraud; however, the recovery of the funds was not successful. The plaintiff claims that the bank is responsible for inadequate protection of its systems, while the bank asserts that it followed the procedure based on the agreed identification methods. 
The court recognizes that there is responsibility on both sides: the bank for inadequate security and prevention of phishing, and the plaintiff for negligence in safeguarding his personal information, despite the bank's relevant warnings. A critical issue is the exact timing of the completion of the transfer: if the bank was timely notified of the fraud but did not intervene, it may be fully liable. The court requests a resumption of the discussion and further evidence, mainly from the bank, which has access to the relevant technical details.
