Court (Civil/Criminal): Criminal  
Provisions: Article 42 paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 7 of Law 4557/2018  
Time of commission of the act:  
Outcome (not guilty, guilty):  
Reasoning: Obligation of the payment service provider, such as banks, to inform their contracting customer after receiving a relevant order for a payment to be made on their behalf. Content of the above notification at the stage of receiving the payment order and during its execution. Terms of liability for the provider regarding compensation for non-execution, erroneous, or delayed execution of payment transactions. In particular, in the case of an unauthorized or erroneous payment, the user is required to notify the provider within a specified timeframe as soon as they become aware of the corresponding transaction. The provisions of Law 4357/2018 establish mandatory legal regulations in favor of users of payment services and cannot be contractually modified to their detriment, but only to their benefit. Defenses available to payment service providers to relieve them of liability. Burden of proof distribution between the parties. This responsibility of banks may also stem from Law 2251/1994, as they provide services to the public and are considered suppliers. Conditions for supplier liability under the aforementioned legislation. Distribution of the burden of proof between the litigants to demonstrate liability for compensation under Law 2251/1994. Terms of concurrency between contractual and tort liability for compensation. The court partially accepts the lawsuit.  
Facts: On 01/09/2021, an unknown perpetrator sent an email to her from the electronic address “...............”, in which they stated that for security reasons she needed to confirm her account with the bank ....... Not realizing that it was a scam, she followed the attached hyperlink, entered her personal information, resulting in an unknown perpetrator intercepting her online banking credentials and making a transfer totaling 7,000.00 euros to account number ................ of the bank .........  
C) The beneficiary of the aforementioned account is ......... born on 16/05/1995 in the Municipality of ........., residing at .............., with ID number .................... issued on 02/10/2009 by T.A .............. and tax number ............. from the tax office ...................  
D) The criminal proceeds reportedly arising from the above criminal activity amount to a total of seven thousand euros (7,000.00€). Following the above, serious suspicions arise that the aforementioned criminal proceeds transferred to the aforementioned bank account were unlawfully appropriated by her and subsequently mixed with other legally held assets, which she used in her overall economic activities, aiming to launder them, thus concealing their true origin and making it impossible for them to be seized. Therefore, there are reasonable suspicions that the aforementioned individual committed not only the primary offense but also the criminal act of “Money Laundering” (Article 2 §1 a, d of Law 4557/2018, in conjunction with Article 4 subparagraph z of the same law as it stands, as well as Article 39 paragraph 1 subparagraphs a & c of the same Law 4557/2018). Because there are serious suspicions that the bank account numbered .......... maintained at the bank ....................., whose beneficiary is ..... (Tax ID ....................), contains part of the monetary amount from the aforementioned criminal activity that was placed behind banking secrecy to conceal its true origin and ultimately to launder it. Because, in this case, part of the criminal proceeds has been found while the remainder has not been found in its entirety, there is a lawful reason and an urgent case for prohibiting the sale or any other transfer of the following assets, given that they are subject to seizure and forfeiture according to Articles 40 and 42 of Law 4557/2018 as they currently stand.
