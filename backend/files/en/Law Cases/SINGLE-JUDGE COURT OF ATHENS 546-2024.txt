**Provisions:**  
**Time of commission of the act:**  
**Outcome (not guilty, guilty):**  
**Reasoning:** Claim for compensation and monetary satisfaction due to moral damage against a mobile phone company and a credit institution within the framework of inadequate fulfillment of a payment services contract for "web banking." Appropriate actions for mobile phone companies in case of a request for a "sim" card replacement due to wear or loss. They must verify the customer's identity based on the personal details and identification information registered in their system but are not liable for any changes in the latter that were not timely communicated to them. Further security measures such as phone communication or sending an SMS to the mobile number holder are not required. Payment services under Law 4357/2018. Obligation of the payment service provider, such as banks, to inform the payer after receiving a relevant order for making a payment. The content of this varies per case, such as sending a personalized code to the user's mobile phone for transaction approval, as well as sending an email immediately after its completion. However, the bank is not liable for customer damage resulting from illicit electronic transactions due to third-party interception of either the access codes for electronic banking transactions or the sim card and the phone number to which the personalized codes for approving the aforementioned transactions are sent, within the framework of increased security protocols. Appropriate actions by banks upon diagnosing illicit banking transactions that may be fraudulent. Relevant criteria for consideration. The evidence did not indicate negligent and thus tortious behavior from all defendants. The claim is dismissed.  

**Facts:** In the present claim, upon due assessment of its content, the plaintiff states that he has a mobile phone subscription with the first defendant, a mobile phone company. On October 26, 2020, in the morning, he realized that his mobile phone was offline, and by noon, he received email notifications from Bank .......... and ............ (whose third and fourth defendants are de facto universal successors, respectively), with which he holds an account, regarding transactions he had made. From phone calls from his home phone to Bank .............. and ............ Bank, he was informed that on the same day, in a very short period, four money transfers had been made from the account he maintains at Bank .............., specifically, an amount of €15,000 was transferred to the account mentioned in the claim document under the name ..........., at ........ an amount of €15,000 was transferred to the account mentioned in the claim document under the name ......... at ........... Bank, an amount of €15,000 was transferred to the plaintiff's account with his daughter as a co-holder at ......... Bank, and an amount of €6,700 was transferred from another of his accounts to the account from which the transfer to the aforementioned accounts of €45,000 was made. Additionally, from the plaintiff's account with his daughter as a co-holder at .......... Bank, an amount of €9,999 was transferred to an account under the name of .... . He attempted to log into the online banking service of Bank ......... from his home computer, but found that the service was locked, while regarding the corresponding service of ........... Bank, he requested alongside his daughter to 'lock' it. In a phone call with the call center of Bank ............, he was informed about the locking of his electronic account in the online banking service and was told to dispute the transactions, which he did immediately through ... banking, while his daughter communicated about this with ....... Bank. The transfer to the account with the beneficiary was canceled, and the amount of €15,000 was returned to the plaintiff. After his investigation, he discovered that an unknown individual appeared at the branch of the first defendant, served by the second defendant, who posed as the plaintiff and presented a forged military ID card of the plaintiff, requesting and receiving a new sim card, resulting in the deactivation of the plaintiff's sim card and gaining access to the codes sent to him by the banks for completing the transfers. Due to the negligence of the second defendant, he did not realize that the identity used was forged, as since 2010, when the plaintiff retired, he has had a police identification card. The first defendant does not have security protocols to prevent such incidents, which constitute the sim .... method, despite the issuance of a press release from the Attica Security and numerous publications regarding the aforementioned method, unlike other mobile phone companies, which implement a specific procedure for changing sim cards. The second defendant did not take the obvious step to check the functioning of the sim card before replacing it, where he would have realized that the plaintiff's mobile phone was functioning normally. Bank .......... and ........... Bank: a) accepted requests for transferring large amounts of money from accounts that had no similar activity in the past, while the plaintiff's online banking account with the above banks was locked quite some time later, b) sent email notifications regarding successful transactions in succession, under a single email, c) did not check the address ... of the perpetrators, which was different from that used by the plaintiff, and d) did not take necessary security measures to prevent fraud via sim ... against the plaintiff, as the security code (pin) sent by the banks via message to the mobile phone proved to be compromised. As a result of the above illegal and culpable behavior of the defendants, the plaintiff suffered property damage amounting to a total of €24,999, which constitutes the total amount of the transfers made by third unknown persons to accounts of unknown individuals, as stated above, and has not been refunded despite his repeated inquiries, while he also suffered distress and mental anguish, and his trust in the banks was shaken, thus entitling him to monetary compensation for his moral damage, amounting to €5,000.
