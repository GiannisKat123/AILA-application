Court (Civil/Criminal): Civil  
Provisions: Law 4537/2018.  
Time of commission of act:  
Outcome (not guilty, guilty):  
Reasoning: PARTIALLY ACCEPTS the lawsuit. RECOGNIZES the obligation of the defendant (a) to pay the plaintiffs in full the amount of eight thousand eight hundred ninety (8,890) euros, with legal interest from December 2, 2021, and (b) to pay each of the plaintiffs the amount of five hundred (500) euros with legal interest from the service of the lawsuit.  
Facts: The plaintiffs claim that they are co-beneficiaries of a savings account held by the defendant, and that unknown perpetrators gained access to the aforementioned account via the internet, without the plaintiffs themselves having any fault regarding the safeguarding of the codes or the disclosure of the unique transaction codes (OTR). They assert that the defendant is responsible for the access gained by the unknown perpetrators to the savings account, as the defendant negligently violated the protective obligations it owed to the plaintiffs. They state that, due to the actions of the unknown perpetrators, gradual transfers of monetary amounts were made, resulting in the aforementioned savings account being depleted by the amount of 10,120 euros within a few minutes. They informed the defendant of the aforementioned actions through the appropriate channels; however, the defendant negligently delayed the necessary actions. The defendant denies any liability and the return of the aforementioned monetary amount.
