Court (Civil/Criminal): Civil  
Provisions:  
Time of commission: July 21, 2020  
Outcome (innocent, guilty): Partially accepts the lawsuit against the Bank.  
Reasoning: Alongside the bank's responsibility for the ineffective protection of its systems against the continually changing and evolving methods of deception that affect them, leading to financial damage for its clients who entrusted it, which constitutes a breach of its contractual obligations and generates contractual liability, there is also the personal responsibility of the plaintiff, who did not safeguard, as required, his sensitive banking information and disclosed it when he should not have, even though the message that misled him came from the context of an SMS conversation with the defendant, even if he was directed through the link to a website resembling that of the defendant, because he overlooked the relevant instructions and strict recommendations of the bank, violating his duty to safeguard them. Therefore, in light of the above, the court must partially accept the lawsuit regarding its substance, and with the defendant's objection regarding the plaintiff's fault being accepted at a rate of 1/6 of the damage suffered, it must be acknowledged – following the admissible and lawful modification of the lawsuit's request from a dismissive to a declaratory nature as proposed – the defendant's obligation to pay him the amount of €2,500, with legal interest, as specified in the operative part. Regarding the request to recognize the defendant's obligation to pay him €1,000 as compensation for the moral damage he suffered from the fraud committed against him, this is deemed dismissible as unfounded, because the defendant's liability is contractual and not tortious, and there are no special conditions justifying the treatment of this specific non-contractual behavior as tortious, making it possible to attribute moral damage to the plaintiff from the defendant.  
Facts: The plaintiff maintained a joint bank account with his wife and had access to the defendant bank's e-banking. On July 21, 2020, following successful identification via the agreed-upon credentials (userID, password, OTP), a request was made to change the mobile phone number for receiving OTPs, which was completed through the bank's platform. However, this change was not made by the plaintiff himself, but by a third party who had previously deceived him using the phishing method, obtaining his banking details through a misleading SMS. Following the phone number change, on July 31, 2020, a transfer of €3,000 was made to a third party's account. The transaction was conducted using the necessary credentials and OTP sent to the new mobile phone, resulting in the bank considering the order valid and executing it. Once the plaintiff realized the transfer, he immediately contacted the bank and informed them that he had not given such an order himself. Despite the initial assurance that the funds could be recovered, they were ultimately not returned, as they had been transferred to a third party's account, and the bank denied any responsibility for the loss.
