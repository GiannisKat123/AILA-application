In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the controller shall not refuse to act on the request of the data subject for exercising his or her rights under Articles 15 to 22, unless the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the data subject. 3.The controller shall provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The controller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic form means, the information shall be provided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject. 4.If the controller does not take action on the request of the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy. 5.Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any communication and any actions taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 shall be provided free of charge. Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may either: (a)  charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or (b)  refuse to act on the request. The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request. 6.Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject. 7.The information to be provided to data subjects pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 may be provided in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically they shall be machine-readable. 8.The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 for the purpose of determining the information to be presented by the icons and the procedures for providing standardised icons.

In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive 95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas that need more specific provisions. This Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the processing of special categories of personal data (\u2018sensitive data\u2019). To that extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful. 4.5.2016 L 119/2 Official Journal of the European Union EN", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1557, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a56186fa-ae43-4f7f-9d59-d8d4b41d3f39": {"__data__": {"id_": "a56186fa-ae43-4f7f-9d59-d8d4b41d3f39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"id": "gdpr_101", "source": "GDPR", "doc_type": "regulation", "title": "General Data Protection Regulation - Recital 100", "lang": "en"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5b66e5cf-9865-427d-ba14-c22c7eb7c1b9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"id": "gdpr_101", "source": "GDPR", "doc_type": "regulation", "title": "General Data Protection Regulation - Recital 100", "lang": "en"}, "hash": "dbd4073154c70906b5b4e597e7362b365631e6a97b5415f4a39a7e85e19bf1b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In order to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the establishment of certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged, allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and services.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 278, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b39437d7-6ffc-4498-aa99-0ff336446e51": {"__data__": {"id_": "b39437d7-6ffc-4498-aa99-0ff336446e51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"id": "gdpr_102", "source": "GDPR", "doc_type": "regulation", "title": "General Data Protection Regulation - Recital 101", "lang": "en"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6a8beeb0-5fda-4503-99ec-bacde578cdc1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"id": "gdpr_102", "source": "GDPR", "doc_type": "regulation", "title": "General Data Protection Regulation - Recital 101", "lang": "en"}, "hash": "9c2ec0fd1dbe1e53ce017703ed7c8c025f3cf908e24a77a2e482d293a5a8f204", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Flows of personal data to and from countries outside the Union and international organisations are necessary for the expansion of international trade and international cooperation.
