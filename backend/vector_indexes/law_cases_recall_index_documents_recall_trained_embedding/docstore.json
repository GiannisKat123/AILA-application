Specifically, during the period from June 2007 to June 2008, after unlawfully acquiring the aforementioned STICK containing the access codes, she accessed a website maintained by ..., using, without the complainants' knowledge (without their consent or approval), the access codes for the electronic management system of the bank accounts held at the aforementioned Bank, transferring through electronically transmitted orders to the joint account number ... of the complainants from bank accounts numbered ..., ..., and ..., the total amount of \u20ac55,710, as detailed in the orders, and subsequently, using an ATM card, she gradually withdrew from the aforementioned account number ..., the total amount of \u20ac55,710, making 84 individual withdrawals from automatic teller machines.

Not realizing that it was a scam, she followed the attached hyperlink, entered her personal information, resulting in an unknown perpetrator intercepting her online banking credentials and making a transfer totaling 7,000.00 euros to account number ................ of the bank .........  \nC) The beneficiary of the aforementioned account is ......... born on 16/05/1995 in the Municipality of ........., residing at .............., with ID number .................... issued on 02/10/2009 by T.A .............. and tax number ............. from the tax office ...................  \nD) The criminal proceeds reportedly arising from the above criminal activity amount to a total of seven thousand euros (7,000.00\u20ac). Following the above, serious suspicions arise that the aforementioned criminal proceeds transferred to the aforementioned bank account were unlawfully appropriated by her and subsequently mixed with other legally held assets, which she used in her overall economic activities, aiming to launder them, thus concealing their true origin and making it impossible for them to be seized. Therefore, there are reasonable suspicions that the aforementioned individual committed not only the primary offense but also the criminal act of \u201cMoney Laundering\u201d (Article 2 \u00a71 a, d of Law 4557/2018, in conjunction with Article 4 subparagraph z of the same law as it stands, as well as Article 39 paragraph 1 subparagraphs a & c of the same Law 4557/2018). Because there are serious suspicions that the bank account numbered .......... maintained at the bank ....................., whose beneficiary is ..... (Tax ID ....................), contains part of the monetary amount from the aforementioned criminal activity that was placed behind banking secrecy to conceal its true origin and ultimately to launder it. Because, in this case, part of the criminal proceeds has been found while the remainder has not been found in its entirety, there is a lawful reason and an urgent case for prohibiting the sale or any other transfer of the following assets, given that they are subject to seizure and forfeiture according to Articles 40 and 42 of Law 4557/2018 as they currently stand.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3957, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5dcefb21-34c3-497a-914b-93840d538c85": {"__data__": {"id_": "5dcefb21-34c3-497a-914b-93840d538c85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"id": "case_5", "title": "Court of Peace of Athens 1496-2024", "source": "Greek Court Decisions", "doc_type": "case_law", "jurisdiction": "GR", "case_id": "case_5", "civil_or_criminal": "civil", "outcome": "unknown", "relevant_laws": [""], "lang": "en"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a9a29d6f-8ae6-433e-b319-29003f0952e5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"id": "case_5", "title": "Court of Peace of Athens 1496-2024", "source": "Greek Court Decisions", "doc_type": "case_law", "jurisdiction": "GR", "case_id": "case_5", "civil_or_criminal": "civil", "outcome": "unknown", "relevant_laws": [""], "lang": "en"}, "hash": "ff1571cab8b1e84f7036d7332c9a4509698dfa7a1dbe793e216130bcd5ca1774", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Court (Civil/Criminal): Civil  \nProvisions: Directive 2015/366, Law 4537/2018  \nTime of the act: 31.08.2022  \nOutcome (not guilty, guilty): Partially accepts the claim.  \nReasoning: The Athens Peace Court ordered the bank to return the amount that was withdrawn from the plaintiffs' account and to pay additional compensation for the moral damage they suffered.  \nFacts: The case concerns plaintiffs who fell victim to electronic fraud via phishing, resulting in the withdrawal of money from their bank account.

Following the application/contract dated January 9, 2019, the plaintiff became a subscriber to the alternative service networks provided by the defendant bank through online banking (.........................). In the aforementioned application, the plaintiff stated that her mobile phone (number .................) would be used by the defendant to send additional security codes for the approval of her transactions via .......................... It is noted that the plaintiff received subscriber code .................., thus enabling her to conduct transactions without her physical presence at the branches of the defendant bank, from fixed or mobile devices (computers, smartphones, tablets), by entering her username and password to access her personal account. Regarding the identification methods, these were agreed upon between the parties and are specified depending on the payment method used. More specifically, the plaintiff had installed the application ...................................... on her mobile phone. According to the terms of the above contract between the parties, the defendant bank (to ensure the protection of its customers in using this application) requires three stages of identification: 1) the input of the customer's personal codes (username and password) in the application .........................., 2) the input of a six-digit code (...................) sent via SMS to the mobile number provided by the customer, to complete the login to ............................. and 3) the input of a new six-digit code (.................) sent in a new SMS to the mobile number provided by the customer, to authenticate the device on which the aforementioned application is installed (usually a mobile phone). \n\nFurthermore, it was established that on October 4, 2021, at 00:07, the plaintiff received a text message (SMS) on her mobile phone (number ...................) with the following content: \".................................\", i.e., \"..........: a payment was attempted from a new device.

As she acknowledges in her lawsuit, she followed the link that was sent to her via SMS and entered her login credentials (i.e., username and password) on the (fake) page she was redirected to.

It is noted that the defendant sent another message to the plaintiff's mobile phone at 00:15, specifically \"..........................\", which was not used (perhaps because it was entered incorrectly by the plaintiff).

In its letter with reference number ...../27.04.2021, the aforementioned Independent Authority informed the plaintiff that the case was outside its mediating role and was therefore archived.

Pursuant to a contract dated June 11, 2010, established in Thessaloniki between the defendant and the plaintiff, the plaintiff was granted access to the electronic banking system (e-banking) to conduct banking transactions remotely. On October 10, 2020, the plaintiff fell victim to electronic fraud through the \"phishing\" method, whereby an unknown perpetrator managed to extract and transfer \u20ac3,000.00 from the plaintiff\u2019s account to another account of the same bank. Specifically, on that day at 6:51 a.m., the plaintiff received an email from the sender \".........\", with the address ..........., informing him that his debit card had been suspended and that online payments and cash withdrawals could not be made until the issue was resolved. The email urged him to confirm his details within the next 72 hours by following a link titled \"card activation.\"  \nThe plaintiff read the above email on his mobile phone around 8:00 a.m., and believing it came from the defendant, he followed the instructions and accessed a website that was identical (a clone) to that of the defendant. On this page, he was asked to enter his login credentials to connect to the service, which he did, and he was subsequently asked to input his debit card details for the alleged activation, which he also provided. Then, to complete the process, a number was sent to his mobile phone at 8:07 a.m. from the sender ........, which he entered, and two minutes later he received a message from the same sender in English stating that the quick access code had been activated on his mobile. A few minutes later, at 8:18 a.m., he received an email from the defendant informing him of the transfer of \u20ac3,000.00 from his account to account number GR ........... held at the same bank, with the beneficiary's details being .......... As soon as the plaintiff read this, he immediately called the defendant's call center and canceled his debit card, the access codes for the service ......., and locked the application .......... At the same time, he verbally submitted a request to dispute and cancel the contested transaction, and in a subsequent phone call, he also canceled his credit card. On the same day, he also sent an email to the defendant informing them in writing of the above and requesting the cancellation of the transaction and the return of the amount of \u20ac3,000.00 to his account, as this transfer was not made by him but by an unknown perpetrator through electronic fraud and was not approved by him. It should also be noted that the plaintiff, as the sole beneficiary according to the aforementioned contract for using the defendant's Internet Banking service, never received any update via SMS or the VIBER application from the bank regarding the transaction details before its completion, nor did he receive a one-time code (OTP) to approve the contested transaction. He subsequently filed a complaint against unknown persons at the Cyber Crime Division for the crime of fraud. The defendant sent an email to the plaintiff on October 16, 2020, informing him that his request had been forwarded to the appropriate department of the bank for investigation, stating that the bank would never send him an email or SMS asking him to enter his personal data and that as of October 7, 2020, there was a notice posted for its customers regarding malicious attempts to steal personal data in the \"Our News\" section on .......

Specifically, it was proven that the contested transaction was not carried out following a strong identification of the plaintiff \u2013 the sole beneficiary of the account \u2013 and his approval, as the latter may have entered his personal codes on the counterfeit website; however, he was never informed, before the completion of the contested transaction, of the amount that would be transferred from his account to a third-party account, nor did he receive on his mobile phone, either via SMS or through the VIBER application or any other means, the one-time code - extra PIN for its completion, which he was required to enter to approve the contested transaction (payment action) and thus complete his identification, a fact that was not countered by any evidence from the defendant. Furthermore, it is noted that the defendant's claims that it bears no responsibility under the terms of the banking services contract, whereby it is not liable for any damage to its customer in cases of unauthorized use of their personal access codes to the Internet Banking service, are to be rejected as fundamentally unfounded. This is because the aforementioned contractual terms are invalid according to the provision of Article 103 of Law 4537/2018, as they contradict the provisions of Articles 71, 73, and 92 of the same Law, which provide for the provider's universal liability and its exemption only for unusual and unforeseen circumstances that are beyond the control of the party invoking them and whose consequences could not have been avoided despite all efforts to the contrary; these provisions establish mandatory law in favor of users, as according to Article 103 of Law 4537/2018, payment service providers are prohibited from deviating from the provisions to the detriment of payment service users, unless the possibility of deviation is explicitly provided and they can decide to offer only more favorable terms to payment service users; the aforementioned contractual terms do not constitute more favorable terms but rather disadvantageous terms for the payment service user. In this case, however, the defendant did not prove the authenticity of the transaction and its approval by the plaintiff and did not invoke, nor did any unusual and unforeseen circumstances beyond its control, the consequences of which could not have been avoided despite all efforts to the contrary, come to light. Therefore, the contested transaction transferring the amount of \u20ac3,000.00 is considered, in the absence of demonstrable consent from the plaintiff, unapproved according to the provisions of Article 64 of Law 4537/2018, and the defendant's contrary claims are rejected, especially since the plaintiff proceeded, according to Article 71 paragraph 1 of Law 4537/2018, without undue delay to notify the defendant regarding the contested unapproved payment action. Consequently, the defendant is liable for compensating the plaintiff for the positive damage he suffered under Article 73 of Law 4537/2018 and is obliged to pay him the requested amount of \u20ac703.18, while the plaintiff\u2019s fault in the occurrence of this damage cannot be established, as he entered his personal details in an online environment that was a faithful imitation of that of the defendant, as evidenced by the comparison of the screenshots of the fake website and the real website provided by the plaintiff, a fact that he could not have known while being fully convinced that he was transacting with the defendant.

Although the plaintiff acted promptly and informed the defendant on the same day about the contested incident, the defendant did not act as promptly regarding the investigation of the incident and the freezing of the account that held the fraudulent credit to prevent the plaintiff's loss, but only returned part of the funds to the plaintiff a month later.

A third party fraudulently obtained money from the plaintiff's bank account and transferred it to another bank account. Both the defendant is liable for the inadequate protection of its systems, which should have been excellent, and the plaintiff who failed to fulfill his obligation to protect his information and disregarded the defendant's security instructions.

On July 31, 2020, at 13:45, the plaintiff was informed of a transfer of \u20ac3,000 from his account, which he had not initiated, nor had his wife. At 14:05, he immediately contacted the bank\u2019s customer service line and reported the incident, stating that it was not his action and requesting its cancellation. The bank employee found that the plaintiff had provided his details to a fake website 10 days earlier, and subsequently, the mobile number used for transaction confirmations had been changed. The employee informed him that the money was at the other bank and that they would logically be able to retrieve it, provided it had not already been transferred to a third party's account. Since then, the plaintiff has not seen any return of the amount to his account, and he has made numerous attempts to resolve the issue with the bank, with effort, costs, and distress; however, nothing was achieved, as the money had already entered a third party's account and the defendant denied responsibility for the transfer of the funds.\nFacts: The plaintiff maintained a joint account with his wife at a bank and used internet banking services. On July 21, 2020, a third party deceived the plaintiff through phishing (a misleading SMS with a link), obtaining his banking credentials. The third party, using the stolen information, requested a phone number change for receiving OTP (one-time password) and completing electronic transactions. The bank completed the change process based on the correct credentials. On July 31, 2020, a transfer of \u20ac3,000 was made from the plaintiff's account to a third party. The plaintiff was immediately informed, called the bank, and reported the fraud; however, the recovery of the funds was not successful. The plaintiff claims that the bank is responsible for inadequate protection of its systems, while the bank asserts that it followed the procedure based on the agreed identification methods. \nThe court recognizes that there is responsibility on both sides: the bank for inadequate security and prevention of phishing, and the plaintiff for negligence in safeguarding his personal information, despite the bank's relevant warnings. A critical issue is the exact timing of the completion of the transfer: if the bank was timely notified of the fraud but did not intervene, it may be fully liable.

Regarding the request to recognize the defendant's obligation to pay him \u20ac1,000 as compensation for the moral damage he suffered from the fraud committed against him, this is deemed dismissible as unfounded, because the defendant's liability is contractual and not tortious, and there are no special conditions justifying the treatment of this specific non-contractual behavior as tortious, making it possible to attribute moral damage to the plaintiff from the defendant.  \nFacts: The plaintiff maintained a joint bank account with his wife and had access to the defendant bank's e-banking. On July 21, 2020, following successful identification via the agreed-upon credentials (userID, password, OTP), a request was made to change the mobile phone number for receiving OTPs, which was completed through the bank's platform. However, this change was not made by the plaintiff himself, but by a third party who had previously deceived him using the phishing method, obtaining his banking details through a misleading SMS. Following the phone number change, on July 31, 2020, a transfer of \u20ac3,000 was made to a third party's account. The transaction was conducted using the necessary credentials and OTP sent to the new mobile phone, resulting in the bank considering the order valid and executing it. Once the plaintiff realized the transfer, he immediately contacted the bank and informed them that he had not given such an order himself.

On October 26, 2020, in the morning, he realized that his mobile phone was offline, and by noon, he received email notifications from Bank .......... and ............ (whose third and fourth defendants are de facto universal successors, respectively), with which he holds an account, regarding transactions he had made. From phone calls from his home phone to Bank .............. and ............ Bank, he was informed that on the same day, in a very short period, four money transfers had been made from the account he maintains at Bank .............., specifically, an amount of \u20ac15,000 was transferred to the account mentioned in the claim document under the name ..........., at ........ an amount of \u20ac15,000 was transferred to the account mentioned in the claim document under the name ......... at ........... Bank, an amount of \u20ac15,000 was transferred to the plaintiff's account with his daughter as a co-holder at ......... Bank, and an amount of \u20ac6,700 was transferred from another of his accounts to the account from which the transfer to the aforementioned accounts of \u20ac45,000 was made. Additionally, from the plaintiff's account with his daughter as a co-holder at .......... Bank, an amount of \u20ac9,999 was transferred to an account under the name of .... . He attempted to log into the online banking service of Bank ......... from his home computer, but found that the service was locked, while regarding the corresponding service of ........... Bank, he requested alongside his daughter to 'lock' it. In a phone call with the call center of Bank ............, he was informed about the locking of his electronic account in the online banking service and was told to dispute the transactions, which he did immediately through ... banking, while his daughter communicated about this with ....... Bank. The transfer to the account with the beneficiary was canceled, and the amount of \u20ac15,000 was returned to the plaintiff.
